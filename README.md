To run the experiments presented in the paper, first install the necessary dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
There are two scripts available for running the experiments:
- `experiment_1.sh`: Generates the results for the left plot in Figure 1.
- `experiment_2.sh`: Generates the results for the right plot in Figure 1.
